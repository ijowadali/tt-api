2. Development

==> Domain Name: develop.insync-crm-api.com
```

## How to Install

1. Clone repository

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/abendsoft/insync-crm-api.git
   cd insync-crm-api
   yarn install
   ```

2. Create a new `.env` file for the backend and generate a new `APP_KEY`. Copy the output and paste it into the `.env` file at the end of the line for `APP_KEY`.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   node ace generate:key #Generates new APP_KEY
   ```
3. Within the `.env` file, configure the MYSQL\* variables to suit your environment setup.

4. launch `start development` server.

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

5. You won't be able to `login` because there are no users. So, it is time to seed the database.

6. To prepare (seed) the database with mock data:

   1. First, let's migrate the database.

      ```bash
      node ace migration:run
      ```

   2. Next, Let's seed important tables on the database. Run the index seeder command below to run all configured seeders for the application and fully setup it up in one command:

      ```bash
      node ace db:seed --files="database/seeders/MainSeeder/Index.ts"
      ```

      If you are on Windows and having errors, you can run:

      ```bash
      node ace db:seed --files="database\seeders\MainSeeder\Index.ts"
      ```

      Please note that this operation could take a couple of minutes.

7. After running the index seeder, all users generated will be logged to file. Check the file: `database/data/seeded_users.txt` and take note of the user credentials logged to the file.
8. Get an email and password of a user and log in.
9. Congratulations. You have successfully set up the InSync.
